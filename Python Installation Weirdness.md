You can have multiple versions on Python on your machine, but it's tricky to get the right one as the main one.

- When installing a new version, have the installer add Python to your path.
- Go to Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases and uncheck all Python apps. This will force your path to stop looking at any aliases.
- You should be able to use Python now!
